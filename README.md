The Perfect Pizza!

Big Picture: This program will be a memorization game for different pizzas. First the user will be prompted a difficulty level from easy, medium, and hard. Then a random pizza will be generated for a certain amount of seconds with a clock counting the time on the screen. Then you will have a certain amount of seconds to drag the ingredients onto a blank pizza to recreate it. You will have a certain amount of chances which are deducted for each wrong ingredient or missing ingredient for the pizza. As you get more pizzas correct, the amount of time you have available to recreate the pizza decreases as well as difficulty. You input your name before playing and a leaderboard of scores appears so you can compare your scores with friends!

First Round: First I will get a picture of a plain pizza up on the screen with different toppings on the sides which you can drag onto the pizza in which they will appear. I will also create an intro menu in which you will be prompted your name as well as an option to see the leaderboard.

Test Plan: After completing the first round, you will be able to input your name after pressing "Start" and a picture of a pizza will appear after you do so. You will drag the pepperoni topping and see it appear on the pizza.
