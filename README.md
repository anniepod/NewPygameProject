The Perfect Pizza!

Big Picture:

This program will help you order the perfect pizza using pygame. First, the user would choose from a list of neighborhoods in Queens. Next a list of pizzerias in that neighborhood would appear. The user would be able to filter them in different categories- for example: from most to least expensive, highest reviewed to lowest reviewed, etc. Upon clicking the pizzeria, information about that pizzeria would appear such as the phone number, address, images of the establishment, etc. Finally, the user clicks a button which leads them to customize their own pizza. The user will be able to choose different options for their pizza, such as size of pizza, type of crust, toppings (including a slider to indicate how much topping they want), all in an interactive visual display which displays the pizza as it is being created and updated by the user. The number of calories will be kept track of in a counter with each additional element added to the pizza as well as the total cost for their customization. When they are ready to order, they click "Check Out" and the total cost with sales tax appears as well as an option to add a percentage tip for the delivery guy. Upon ordering, the user is asked if they want to order any more pizza, and the menu starts all over again.

First Round:

In the first round, I plan to solidify the pizza customization/creation menu, which is most involved in pygame. I will create several "steps" which the user can go back and forth with. In the first step, I will create a choice for a user to choose a size pizza which they can input a size in inches in diameter of the pizza pie and which will be displayed onto the screen. The next step will involve choosing different sauces and cheeses which the user can drag onto the image of the plain pizza crust - the user can drag different elements onto the pie. The next step is the toppings which the user can drag onto the pizza from different "piles" of topping options. All the while this is happening, a calorie counter will be adding up the total number of calories and other nutrition facts from the user's choices.

Test Plan:

The user will input a 10 inch diameter pizza which will prompt an image of 10 inch pizza sized to scale. Next the user will select sauce and spread the sauce as the user holds the mouse down. Next, the cheese will be spread by holding down the mouse. Then, in the next step pepperoni will be selected by placing 10 pieces of pepperoni is random spots on the pizza. The end should have a customized image of a pizza with the calorie counter increasing with each additional element.
